**ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE**
 
 AI is the science of building machines and systems that can perform tasks which require human intelligence

 **GOALS OF AI**

- learn from experience  
- understand and process language  
- recognize pattern   
- make decisions and problem problems

**TYPES OF AI**  
 ![alt text](typessAi.png)
1. Narrow AI

- Specializes on one task  
2. Generative AI 

- can do any intellectual task a human can do  
3. Super AI
-   A future AI that could surpass human intelligence (still theoretical)
     
  **KEY FIELDS IN AI**

  - Machine learning  
  - Deep learning 
  - Robotics  
  - Computer vision
  - Natural Language Processing(NLP)
    


 
 **MACHINE LEARNING**
   
   Machine learning is a subset of AI where the machines learn patterns from data and improve their performance over time 

   **HOW ML WORKS**

   - feed them data
   -  start to notice pattern and relation
   -  make predictions and decisions

  **TYPES OF ML**

| Type                       | Description                                  | Example                      |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Supervised Learning**    | Learn from labeled data (X â†’ Y)              | Spam email detection         |
| **Unsupervised Learning**  | Find patterns in unlabeled data              | Customer segmentation        |
| **Reinforcement Learning** | Learn through trial and error (reward-based) | Game-playing AI like AlphaGo |
